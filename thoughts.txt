"Pit of Success"

Very little to go back and change

-- Function elements in wrong order

update : State -> Input -> State
-- and then later
Signal.foldp update state0 input

-- = instead of <- on a record
type alias Thing = { x : Int }
{ thing | x = 1 }

-- overriding the `move` method that had already been imported
-- would be nice to put view in seperate module? or allow imports anywhere in file?
